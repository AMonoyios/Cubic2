# Cubic2
 A minecraft inspired project. After taking the challenge to develop minecraft in 1 month a lot of mistakes and issues were noticable; both in architecture and implementation decisions. This revision will be an attempt to complete this project again but give a wider level of flexibility and develop an easier to understand/read architecture.
